In this challenge we had to create a database through SQL where we had 6 tables that were related in some way.
We had to create dependencies like Primary key and Foreign key to go in these tables so that they have relationships between the tables. 

With this SQL database, we then had to create 8 different queries that allowed us to pull data in our database which we can use for later.
